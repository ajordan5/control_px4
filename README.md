# control_px4
To run control_px4 in simulation, use PX4 gazebo without Ros.  A modified version can be found at https://github.com/matthewk-rydalch/PX4-SITL_gazebo.git.
Additionally, a package called listener is needed to obtain messages of the landing pad's location.  This repository can be found here https://github.com/matthewk-rydalch/listener.git
